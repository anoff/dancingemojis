> visualize audio using emojis *

_* because jsconf.eu 2017 taught me that these are the things that matter_

## What now?

Got inspired by some talks on visualizing audio in the browser and a lot of talks that highlighted the importance of emojis.
So why not do both.
Visualize audio in the browser with emojis. ~~Emojis that fit the audio - well if there is some voice text in it.~~

## Issues

Sucks on mobile, should try out http://www.pixijs.com/ for faster drawing.
